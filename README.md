Hello World!

This project was completed with approval from several lecturers at my university. The project focuses on processing two signals, PCG and PPG, for detecting the presence of systolic murmurs. By synchronizing these two signals, the identification of S1 and S2 peaks from the PCG signal can be assisted by the peaks of the PPG signal. Feature extraction was performed using both time and frequency domains, which then served as influential features in the process of detecting systolic murmurs. Using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), these features were utilized for training and testing the ANN model, which was designed with three hidden layers. The dataset used comprised primary and secondary subjects as model validation with known ground truth. The accuracy rate achieved for training and testing was 96:98.
